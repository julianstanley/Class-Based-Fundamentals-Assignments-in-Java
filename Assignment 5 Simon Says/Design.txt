This design description will explain the classes in the sequence that the user would encounter 
those classes.


----- User begins game, and an [IntroWorld] is created------

An [IntroWorld] has no fields, and it's purpose is very simple: to display a "Start" button, and to 
send the user to an [InteractWorld] when they click the start button. The [IntroWorld] asks the
[Utils] class for help in knowing whether the user clicked inside or outside of the start button 
(elaboration on Utils below).


----- User presses start button, and an [InteractWorld] is created------

But, if the game works correctly, the user will not notice that they were sent to an InteractWorld.

In most cases, an InteractWorld exists to take in user input, and check whether the user has pressed
the buttons with the colors that they were shown previously.

The exception is when the user has pressed all of the colors that they have seen so far (and, in 
the very beginning of the game, the user has seen no colors, and therefore they have pressed all of
the colors they have seen so far). In this case, they are sent to a [MovieWorld]

The number of colors that the user needs to click correctly before they are sent to a [MovieWorld]
is kept track of by means of the field *int winNum*.

When the user has pressed all the colors that they have seen so far (e.g., when winNum < 1), they
are sent to a [MovieWorld]. The [InteractWorld] passes the [MovieWorld] it's different color lists,
but it also picks a random number [0,4), which corresponds to a random Color {Red, Cyan, Blue, Green},
which is added onto the lists that [MovieWorld] has to display.


------ Without the user noticing, a [MovieWorld] is created---------

A MovieWorld's only purpose is to display colors to the user. It displays its colors, and then 
sends the work off to a different World. 

A movie world has two ILoColor arguments. The first one, *colors*, is the list of colors that the 
MovieWorld has to display before it has finished its job. The second one, *allColors*, is the 
original list of colors that the InteractWorld sent it.

A MovieWorld also has a *colorCount* argument. This is not entirely necessary, as it is just the 
length of *colors*, but it would be useful if we wanted to, like the example game, have a certain 
color list length that is required to "win" (ex, if getting to a list of colors of length 20 is 
enough to send the user to a winning LastScene), so I decided to keep that in.

Finally, a MovieWorld has a "tick" argument. [InteractWorld] sets this to 0 as a default, and it 
just alternates every time we make a new [MovieWorld], and we only actually show the user a 
new color when the tick is odd--this way, we can put some separation between when the user sees
two subsequent-but-identical colors.

On every odd iteration, the MovieWorld needs to brighten a color, which is does by asking for help
from the [Utils] class (elaboration below), and then it asks [ColorLists] for help in shortening
the *colors*, or the list of colors the MovieWorld still needs to display before its job is done.

When the MovieWorld is out of colors to display (when colorCount !> 1), it needs to send the user
to an [InteractWorld] so they can press the buttons it just displayed.

-------- The user sat through [MovieWorld]'s presentation and an [InteractWorld] is created-----

The InteractWorld will now get [Utils]' help in deciding whether the user has clicked the right 
button. If the user clicks the wrong button, [InteractWorld] will call on lastScene(String msg) 
to create the losing screen, and [InteractWorld] will provide the current score by looking at the
length of the *allColors* argument--the list of colors in InteractWorld that doesn't change 
through interations.

Some additional information:


-------- Utils -------
Utils is our utilities class. It doesn't have any fields, but it knows how to make colors 
transparent (by keeping the color RGB, but changing the alpha) and how to check whether a Posn
is within a given posn and a given tolerance (by subtracting the posn values by the tolerance values
and comparing). 

------- ColorLists -------
ColorLists.java was submitted for a previous assignment. It's the backbone behind the list of colors
that our Worlds use. ColorLists can do all so, sorts of fun things. It knows how to append a color
to the end of itself, how to find its length, and even compare itself to another list of colors.
