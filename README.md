# Class Based Fundamentals Assignments
*For collaboration between my partners and I on the second-semester of the introductory computer science sequence at Northeastern University.*

## This is the coursework for a Fall 2018 Computer Science course.

#### I've purposefully not mentioned the official name of the course in the title and description to discourage plagiarism.

The official assignment names are as follows:

* Assignment 1: Designing complex data

* Assignment 2: Designing methods for complex data

* Assignment 3: Designing methods for complex data; Practice with accumulators

* Assignment 4: Abstracting over Data Definitions; Constructors

* Assignment 5: Equality for Unions, Games

* Assignment 6: Function objects and generics

* Assignment 7: Visitors and Cyclic data

* Assignment 8: Doubly-linked lists

* Assignment 9: Minesweeper

* Assignment 10: Light Em' All

The final assignment gives a good overview of the concepts learned in this class. It includes: (1) a working implementation of generic-type heapsort, (2) abstracted functionality (3) use of various loops, both in the core code and testing
